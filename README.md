Browser Tweent is a PHP application that allows you to send Tweets to your Twitter without having to sign in. This application is built using the codebird-php Twitter Library.

To get started, you need to create an app on the Twitter Developers site. Once you've done this, you will need to navigate through your app information and find 4 keys - 'Your Key', 'Your Secret', 'Your Token' and 'Your Token Secret'.
After finding these keys, you can just fill in the appropriate fields with they keys and just add a message under 140 characters.

Once it's been validated, it will post your message(Tweet) to your Twitter!
